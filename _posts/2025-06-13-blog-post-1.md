I'm excited to share our new **survey paper** titled  
**_“Foundation Models in Autonomous Driving: A Survey on Scenario Generation and Scenario Analysis”_** — now available on **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11526)**! 📄  

This work is a joint effort between researchers from **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, **Stanford University**, **Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT)**, **Audi AG**, **Technical University of Darmstadt**, **fortiss GmbH**, and **University of the Bundeswehr Munich**.

It presents the **first systematic survey** exclusively focused on how **foundation models** — including **LLMs, VLMs, MLLMs, Diffusion Models, and World Models** — are being applied to **scenario generation** and **scenario analysis** in the context of **autonomous driving**.

I'm incredibly grateful to have **led and contributed** to this project.
