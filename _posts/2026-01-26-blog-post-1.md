This survey provides a comprehensive overview of how foundation models — including LLMs, VLMs, diffusion models, and world models — are reshaping the landscape of scenario generation and scenario analysis for autonomous driving. We systematically connect advances in AI foundation models with the practical needs of safety-critical testing and validation in autonomous systems.

Excited to contribute to the growing intersection of foundation models and autonomous driving! 🚗✨
