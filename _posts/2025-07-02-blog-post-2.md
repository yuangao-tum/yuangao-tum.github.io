I'm thrilled to announce that our **conference paper**  
**_“From Words to Collisions: LLM-Guided Evaluation and Adversarial Generation of Safety-Critical Driving Scenarios”_**  
has been **accepted at IEEE ITSC 2025!** 🎉📄

🔗 **[Read the paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02145)**  
💡 **[Explore the GitHub repo](https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions)**  

This work bridges natural language understanding and autonomous driving safety by using LLMs to **evaluate** and **generate** critical driving scenarios — turning descriptions into meaningful tests that push the limits of driving systems.

Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of innovation in autonomous systems! 🚗💥
